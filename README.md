# Kaggle competition projects
Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

Here are all the competitions that I've participated in:
1. **Titanic - Machine Learning from disaster**
2. **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques**
