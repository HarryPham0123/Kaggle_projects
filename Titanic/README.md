## Titanic - Machine Learning from disaster
**Link competition**: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
- Titanic ML project is a legendary competition in Kaggle _ The best, first challenge for all ethusiastic ML learned who want to dive into this field. 
- The concept: we use Machine Learning to create a model that can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on specific amount of data
- This project is a binary classification problem: model predict 1 (as survived) OR 0 (as non-survived)

### Skills that I've learned from this project:
**1. Visualize missing value and preprocess**

**2. Features engineering techniques:**
  - Binning continuous features: Transforming numeric features to categorical features by groupping (binning) them into some smaller ranges -> Prevent the affects of outliers from features
  - Frequency encoded binning: This technique is appropriate for ordinal data type to reduce number of features for more convinient one-hot encoding

**3. Feature transformation**
  - Label encoding non-numerical features
  - One-hot Encoding the categorical features
 
**4. Modeling**
  - Some ML regression models: KNN (K-nearest neighbor), SVC (Support vector classifier), random forest, Logistic Regression
  - K-fold Cross validation
  - Hyper parameters tuning
  - Confusing matrix
