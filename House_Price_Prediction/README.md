*Link competition*: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Competition description:
- Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
- With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

In this competition, I got my first silver medal for kernel and learn a lot of interesting skills to solve the regression problem
